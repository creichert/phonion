         I'm still alive and searching for co-developers to help me maintain the builds and keep
         it all up to date.

          Two things that already worked stopped working in in 0.9.9.269: File
          transfer on Windows98 and sending of messages with non-ascii characters,
          because i made a little mistake a week ago and did not enough testing.
          &lt;br&gt;
          Please download version 0.9.9.277

         TorChat 0.9.9.269 released. This version runs on windows 98, and many 
         new features have been implemented and old bugs been fixed. You can
         now send files if you drag them into the chat window, the popup menus
         have been completely reorganized, a polish translation is now available,
         TorChat has now support for multiple profiles, and finally there is
         now a debian archive that will let you use TorChat on Debian and Ubuntu
         without any manual configuration, just as comfortable as the windows
         version. See the changelog for more improvements.
         &lt;/p&gt;

         &lt;p&gt;
         TorChat 0.9.9.191 released. This version has support for translations
         of the user interface. Available translations at the moment are English,
         German, Dutch and French. The Dutch and the French translation are
         partially incomplete. 
         &lt;/p&gt;
         &lt;p&gt;
         Also new in this version is a configuration dialog to manage the 
         settings in torchat.ini.
         &lt;/p&gt;

         <title>All Debian and Ubuntu users must change their ID</title>
         <link>http://code.google.com/p/torchat/?openssl-debian-bug</link>
         <description>
         &lt;p&gt;
         There has been a BIG hole in DEBIAN versions of OpenSSL 
         for the last 2 years, all keys and certificates created since then are 
         BROKEN. This also affects ALL DEBIAN AND UBUNTU USERS of TorChat: You 
         will have to create new TorChat-IDs AFTER upgrading OpenSSL and Tor.
         &lt;/p&gt;
         &lt;p&gt;
         Windows users of TorChat are NOT AFFECTED, as long as you didn't 
         replace the 0.1.2.19 Tor binary with one of the 0.2.0.x development 
         versions. 
         &lt;/p&gt;
         &lt;p&gt;
         So if you are running TorChat on a Debian based Distribution (Ubuntu),
         NO MATTER WICH VERSION OF TOR you use, you will have to update OpenSSL 
         (and maybe Tor), delete the hidden service key which will give you a
         new .onion address. Then you must update your torchat.ini with the
         new address and tell all your buddies about your new ID.
         &lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Version 0.9.9.149 is released</title>
         <link>http://code.google.com/p/torchat/downloads/detail?name=torchat-windows-0.9.9.149.zip</link>
         <description>Version 0.9.9.149 is ready for download. Many things
         in the GUI have been improved. Incoming messages can now be opened
         in the background, the taskbar icon will flash. If a delayed (offline)
         Message is finally sent, a notification with time stamp will be created.
         All windows and the taskbar icon show now the own ID, this is useful
         if you are running more than one instance. The annoying flicker of
         the buddy list, which was introduced with .140 has also been fixed.</description>

         <link>http://code.google.com/p/torchat/downloads/detail?name=torchat-windows-0.9.9.140.zip</link>
         <description>Version 0.9.9.140 is ready for download. This release
         has some improvements in the protocol which are incompatible to older
         releases, so you all should update as soon as possible. The changes 
         have become necessary to smooth the way to some planned features like
         chat rooms and conferences and to fix some flaws in the way buddies
         were added and removed. Also new in this release are pseudo offline
         messages which are stored on the sender's machine until both, sender 
         and receiver see each other online the next time.</description>

         <title>Windows binary of 0.9.9.109 now in the download area as normal</title>
         <link>http://code.google.com/p/torchat/downloads/detail?name=torchat-windows-0.9.9.109.zip</link>
         <description>My quota has now been increased by Google and the windows
         binary can now be found in the download area. Current version is
         0.9.9.109. This version has proven to be the most stable version to date.
         Several bugs have been fixed in this release and the process of
         connecting to buddies is now faster and more reliable.</description>

         <title>Version 0.9.9.109 is released</title>
         <link>http://code.google.com/p/torchat/downloads/detail?name=torchat-source-0.9.9.109.zip</link>
         <description>Version 0.9.9.109 is released. I have made some changes in the way and the order
         in which buddies on the list are connected. New in this version is support for a configuration file.
         You can now use an already running tor proxy in your network by specifying adress and port
         numbers (you mus also configure a hidden service on this proxy). Unfortubetely I hit the quota 
         and am still waiting for Google to increase my limit until I can upload the windows binary.</description>
